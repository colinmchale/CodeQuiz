# Math Quiz

## How It Works

Welcome to my Math Quiz. Here you will be asked 6 math questions after the 60 second timer begins. Click on which answer you beleive is correct. Once you have clicked, the following question will immediately follow. For each question you answer incorrectly, there will be a 10 second penalty taken off the timer. Once you have either run out of questions or run out of time, the game will add your final score to the highscore list where you will be asked to submit your initials. The game will save your results from previous attempts.
